# About The Project

I created "Spring solver" as my first bigger C# project. It is connected with demand in my working place for automatization.
So i Came up with idea of creating this software.

The main purpose of this project is to simulate such situation. Mass is hanging on springs, we know the center of gravity of mass.
We know the properties of springs and size of elements used to fixate the springs and mass. 
As the result we can calculate the deformation of springs, forces acting on them and distances from fixating elements.
